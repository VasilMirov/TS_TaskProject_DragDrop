A simple react project that i used to learn a thing or two.

The project is a task project (called Taskify), you can enter a task and you basically make it completed, delete it or edit it (simple crud).

The entire project is only react + typescript, so no back end.

The data (aka tasks) are stored in a useState hook, so they are not perminant.

On top of that i used a nifty little package to make the list of tasks draggable from one column (active tasks) to the another column (completed tasks).

The point of this project is to enhance and show my TS skills.
